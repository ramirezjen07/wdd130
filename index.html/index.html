            <p>Greetings! I am Jennifer De Gracia from the Philippines. My curiosity fuels my desire to learn new things always seeking out opportunities for growth and development. I recognize that my weaknesses are not limitations, but rather challenges that can shape me into a stronger person. Motherhood has ignited a profound drive within me to become the best version of myself. My ultimate goal in this life is to excel in a chosen field, to become a master of my craft. I believe that by developing my skills and knowledge, I can make a meaningful contribution to my loved ones in this life and in the life to come.</p>
